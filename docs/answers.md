# Integration Manager Test Answers

## Introduction
This document provides comprehensive answers to the technical test challenges, specifically focusing on Points 1 and 3. 

## Point 1: Diagnosis and Operational Improvement
### Understanding the Problem
The integration architecture involves multiple components (API Gateway, Lambdas, Kinesis, DynamoDB, S3, etc.) for automating financial data flows. The goal is to propose metrics and alerts to ensure operational continuity, and suggest improvements for resilience and support team structure.

### Solution Approach
First, we gonna talk about the most relevant metrics and alerts, explain why the metric is relevant, then we gonna tal about resilence improvement, and finally we will propose the structure for an effective support team.

**1. Metrics and Alerts:**


- **API Gateway Endpoint Availability:**
    - **Uptime percentage:** Measures the proportion of time the API is available. Important because high availability is critical for uninterrupted data flows and customer trust.
    - **Average latency:** Tracks the response time of the API. High latency can indicate performance bottlenecks or downstream issues, affecting user experience and SLAs.
    - **4xx/5xx error rates:** Monitors client and server errors. Spikes in these errors can signal misconfigurations, authentication issues, or system failures that need immediate attention.
    - **Alerts:** Downtime below threshold, latency spikes, and error rate increases (500/400). We can use the metrics as a trigger to do some automated recovery actions, or also send and email/slack/teams alert. 


- **Lambdas:**
    - **Successful/failed executions:** Tracks the number of successful and failed Lambda invocations. High failure rates can disrupt the integration pipeline and must be addressed quickly.
    - **Average duration:** Measures how long each Lambda execution takes. Increases may indicate code inefficiencies or resource constraints, potentially leading to timeouts.
    - **Alerts:** Failure rate > X%, execution times over AVG (configured for each client's integration), and timeouts.


- **Kinesis and Firehose:**
    - **Processing delays (iterator age):** Indicates how long records wait before being processed. High iterator age can signal downstream bottlenecks or insufficient processing capacity.
    - **Records in queue:** Monitors the number of unprocessed records. Growth in this metric may indicate a backlog or system slowdown.
    - **Delivery failures:** Tracks failed attempts to deliver data to downstream systems (e.g., S3). Important for ensuring data is not lost.
    - **Alerts:** Iterator age > treshhold, Queue size > X and export failures to S3.


- **DynamoDB:**
    - **Read/write latency (IOPS):** Measures the time taken for database operations. High latency can slow down the entire integration process.
    - **Throttling rate:** Indicates when requests exceed provisioned throughput. Frequent throttling can cause failed operations and data delays.
    - **Alerts:**: throttling > X and IOPS > Y.


- **S3:**
    - **Write failures:** Monitors unsuccessful attempts to store data. Critical for ensuring no data is lost during export.
    - **Alert:** write failures > 0 


- **Business Metrics:**
    - **Integrations processed per hour/day:** Measures system throughput and helps identify trends or drops in activity.
    - **Success rate:** Tracks the proportion of successful integrations. A drop may indicate systemic issues.
    - **Volume anomalies:** Detects unexpected spikes or drops in data volume, which can signal upstream or downstream problems, fraud, or misconfigurations.

**2. Resilience Improvements:**

- **Resilience:**
    - Implement automatic retries with exponential backoff for lambdas.
    - Use DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) in Kinesis/Lambdas to isolate, analyze errors, and reprocess.
    - Data schema versioning and validation to prevent failures from unexpected changes (pydantinc un parsers).
    - Monitor saturation and enable auto-scaling for Lambdas and shards of Kinesis to not loss events.
    - Automated backups and restoration for DynamoDB and S3.
    - Implement Datadog/Sentry/CW to monitor in a better way the whole process.

**3.Support Team Structure:**

The structure and size of the support team would depend on the number of active clients, the complexity of their integrations, and the available budget. For this proposal, I’ll take a conservative approach and assume the budget is constrained.

- **Ticket Intake Channels:**

    To streamline ticket creation and resolution, I would implement two primary intake mechanisms:

   - **AI-Powered Assistant (L0):**
   An AI-driven chatbot or support form available to customers / product team. This tool would leverage internal documentation, playbooks, and past ticket data to automatically resolve common or low-complexity issues—particularly those stemming from customer misunderstanding of the tool. When unable to resolve the issue, the assistant would escalate the case by opening a formal support ticket.

   - **Alert-Driven Ticket Automation:**
   With a strong observability and alerting system in place, tickets should also be created automatically whenever a non-recoverable or high-priority alert is triggered. This ensures proactive identification and resolution before issues impact the customer.

- **Support Team Structure:**
  - **L1/L2 Support Engineer:**
    A technical profile responsible for triaging and resolving mid-complexity issues—primarily related to configuration, data structure mismatches, or user errors. This person would also:
     - Categorize and escalate tickets appropriately.
     - Own internal and external communication during incidents.
     - Monitor and report on key operational metrics.
     - Ensure we learn from incidents and improve over time.

  - **Optional L3 Engineer (Budget-Permitting):**
    If the volume and complexity of tickets justifies it, an additional technical support engineer (L3) could be added to tackle more complex issues before escalating to core development teams. This reduces the load on product and engineering.

- **Organizational Fit**

    The support function would operate as a sub-area within the Technology department. The Integration Manager (or another tech leader) would oversee the area. Depending on company scale and support volume, a dedicated Support Manager could be appointed.

   - **Key Metrics to Guide Team Scaling**

     - **SLA breaches:** Frequent or sustained SLA violations over 2–3 months would indicate the need for more resources or process changes.
     - **Customer satisfaction (NPS / CSAT):** Declining satisfaction is often an early sign of support bottlenecks or knowledge gaps.
     - **Internal feedback:** Friction reported by internal teams (e.g., engineering or customer success) due to delays or misrouted tickets.
     - **Ticket volume per engineer:** Helps determine if existing staff is overloaded or if new roles are needed.

Ultimately, the goal is to maintain a high standard of technical support while enabling scalable growth through automation, self-service, and cross-team collaboration.


## Point 3: No Code Vision and Scalability
### Understanding the Problem
You are leading the integrations team and are mandated to: automate 70% of integrations using a No Code tool, maintain 99.9% uptime SLAs, and reduce support incidents by 50%.

### Solution Approach

**1. What strategy would you follow in the next 6 months?**

### Months 1–2: Discovery, Design & Planning

- Analyze the current portfolio of integrations to identify the most frequent and repetitive patterns that can be automated through No Code tooling. *(2 weeks)*
- Conduct interviews with support and engineering teams to understand high-friction areas and common edge cases. *(1 week)*
- Evaluate the stack and decide whether to build in-house or adopt a third-party solution (e.g., Make or n8n). 
  - *Third-party solutions offer faster time-to-market; however, in-house development may better fit specific use cases and provide more control.* *(1 week)*
- Architect and document a high-level design of the MVP, including component interactions and system diagrams. *(1 week)*
- Present the proposed solution to the team, gather feedback, define required roles, and establish standards and best practices. *(1 week)*
- Reserve 1 week to account for uncertainty or unforeseen events.

---

### Months 3–4: MVP Development & Team Expansion

- Conduct UX/UI design and prototyping. Assuming we go with n8n, we would design a custom frontend (a facade) with a drag-and-drop interface that abstracts n8n's complexity. Use biweekly sprints with partial deliveries. *(4 weeks)*
- In parallel, build or expose any required internal APIs, ETL services, or infrastructure components. *(4 weeks)*
- In parallel, either hire new team members or upskill internal talent to fill any remaining gaps. *(4 weeks)*
- Once the first UX design milestone is approved, the frontend team can begin implementation:
  - *(2 weeks)* for layout and component development
  - *(2 weeks)* for API integration
  - *(1 week)* for testing and feedback iteration
- With the new roles onboarded, integrate and validate the MVP, monitor performance, and stabilize the release. *(3 weeks)*
- Reserve 2 weeks for uncertainty or unforeseen events.

---

### Months 5–6: Rollout & Enablement

- Launch a **beta testing phase** with selected internal teams and top clients. *(6 weeks)*
- Run **enablement sessions and workshops** for CS and onboarding teams, with updated documentation and playbooks as deliverables. *(1 week)*
- Establish **weekly feedback loops** to continuously improve usability and reliability.
- Perform **beta phase analysis**, gathering quantitative and qualitative insights. *(2 weeks)*
- Deploy a **metrics dashboard** to track usage, adoption, and performance. *(4 weeks)*

---

### (Optional) Post-MVP Enhancements

- **Template Library:** Offer pre-built templates for common integration patterns to accelerate adoption.
- **AI Assistant:** Suggest configurations, validations, and guide users through the integration setup process based on historical patterns.
- **Sandbox Environment:** Allow users to test and validate integrations in a safe staging environment without impacting production.

   
**2. What profiles would you hire or develop in your team?**

- **No Code Platform Specialists:**
    - Experts in configuring, customizing, and maintaining the chosen No Code tool.

- **Integration Engineer:**
    - Professionals who can design and implement scalable, secure, and reusable integration patterns. I think if we are talking about lead an integration team we should have at least one of this role. 

- **Automation/DevOps Engineers:**
    - To automate deployment, monitoring, and recovery processes, ensuring high availability and reliability.

- **Support Analysts with No Code Skills:**
    - Team members able to quickly diagnose and resolve issues within the No Code platform, and to empower users to self-serve.

- **UX-UI Designer:**
   - Validate if the design team has capability to addres it,  if not, hire one but temporal.

- **Senior Frontend:**
   - Validate if the Frontend team has capability to addres it, if not, hire one.

**3. How would you measure success?**

- **Automation Rate:**
    - Percentage of integrations automated via the No Code tool (target: 70%+).

- **Uptime Metrics:**
    - SLA compliance (target: 99.9% uptime), tracked via monitoring dashboards.

- **Support Incident Reduction:**
    - Number of support tickets/incidents compared to baseline (target: -50%).

- **Time to Deploy New Integrations:**
    - Average time from request to production for new integrations (should decrease as No Code adoption increases).

- **User Satisfaction:**
    - Internal and client feedback on the No Code experience, measured via surveys and CSAT/NPS.

### Results and Validation
Success will be validated by tracking the above KPIs monthly, conducting regular reviews with stakeholders, and iterating on the strategy based on quantitative and qualitative feedback. Achieving the automation, uptime, and incident reduction targets will demonstrate the effectiveness of the No Code and scalability vision.
